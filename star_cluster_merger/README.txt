README
Four .py files submitted:

Star_Cluster_Class.py - Main code to simulate the merger of two star clusters.

Star_Cluster_Convergence_Tester.py - Code to test convergence of total energy and total 
momentum for the evolution of a single star cluster

Plummer_runner.py - Code to generate the initial conditions of the star clusters using the
Plummer model and saves the output to a csv to allow for runs with the same starting
conditions. Not required by default, only required if importFile==True selected in main code

AD_Kepler_Final.py - Code to plot the Kepler orbits using the Euler, symplectic Euler and 
leapfrog algorithms as well as the energy and angular momentum error for each iterator.
